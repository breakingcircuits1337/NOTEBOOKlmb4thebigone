- 🎵 **Generate AI music** - Suno and Udio with smart style-based provider routing
- 🎬 **Generate AI video** - RunwayML and Pika with image-to-video support
- 🎞️ **Create combined media** - Generate music + video concurrently and merge via ffmpeg
- 🔍 **Search intelligently** - Full-text and vector search across all your content
- 💬 **Chat with context** - AI conversations powered by your research

## 🚀 Quick Start

Choose your installation method:

### 🐳 **Docker (Recommended)**

**Best for most users** - Fast setup with Docker Compose:

→ **[Docker Compose Installation Guide](docs/1-INSTALLATION/docker-compose.md)**
- Multi-container setup (recommended)
- 5-10 minutes setup time
- Requires Docker Desktop

**Quick Start:**
- Get an API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) or setup Ollama
- Create docker-compose.yml (example in guide)
- Run: docker compose up -d
- Access: http://localhost:8502

---

### 💻 **From Source (Developers)**

**For development and contributors:**

→ **[From Source Installation Guide](docs/1-INSTALLATION/from-source.md)**
- Clone and run locally
- 10-15 minutes setup time
- Requires: Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, Docker, uv

**Quick Start:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/breakingcircuits1337/BCs-Book_NG.git
uv sync
make start-all
```

Access: http://localhost:3000 (dev) or http://localhost:8502 (production)

---

### 🐧 **Native / No-Docker (Linux & Mac)**

**No Docker required** — runs SurrealDB, the API, and the frontend as native processes inside a Python venv:

**One-time setup:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/breakingcircuits1337/BCs-Book_NG.git
cd BCs-Book_NG
bash scripts/setup-native.sh   # installs uv, SurrealDB binary, Python venv, Node deps
# then add at least one AI provider key to .env
```

**Launch:**
```bash
bash scripts/launch-native.sh   # starts all services + opens app in browser
# or: make start-native
```

**Add a desktop icon** (GNOME / KDE / XFCE):
```bash
bash scripts/install-desktop.sh --mode=native
```
The app then appears in your application launcher. Clicking it starts everything automatically. All data is stored in `data/` and survives restarts.

**Stop:**
```bash
bash scripts/launch-native.sh --stop   # or: make stop-native
```

## Star History

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=breakingcircuits1337/BCs-Book_NG&type=date&legend=top-left)](https://www.star-history.com/#breakingcircuits1337/BCs-Book_NG&type=date&legend=top-left)


## Media Generation Provider Matrix

BCs BookNG adds native music and video generation via four specialized providers:

| Provider | Type | Smart-routed for | Requires |
|----------|------|-----------------|---------|
| **Suno** | Music | Vocals, songs with lyrics, pop, rock, hip-hop | `SUNO_API_KEY` |
| **Udio** | Music | Instrumental, ambient, cinematic, classical, jazz | `UDIO_API_KEY` |
| **RunwayML** | Video | Cinematic, photorealistic, nature, product | `RUNWAY_API_KEY` |
| **Pika** | Video | Animated, cartoon, stylized, abstract, anime | `PIKA_API_KEY` |

> **Combined mode** generates music + video concurrently and merges them with ffmpeg. All four providers support an optional style hint and duration parameter. Set any subset of keys — the smart router uses only configured providers with automatic fallback.
